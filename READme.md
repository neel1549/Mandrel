This project involves building a web application that syncs users from a Slack workspace and displays the user list. The app will integrate with Slack's API to pull user data (such as names, emails, and profile updates) from the workspace and display it in a web interface. Additionally, the app will listen for Slack webhooks to automatically update the user list whenever a user is added or their profile is updated.
